# Diamond Bidding Game Report Summary

## Introduction
This project explores the development of strategies for the card game 'Diamond Bids' using GenAI.

## Problem Statement
The task involved teaching GenAI the rules of the game, exploring strategies, and implementing the game in Python.

## Teaching GenAI the Game
- Through interactive prompts, GenAI learned the game mechanics and strategies.
- Final understanding included player count, card distribution, bidding process, scoring, and possible variations.

## Iterating upon Strategy
- Strategies were developed for both 3-player and 2-player games.
- GenAI provided insights, analyzed user's strategies, and suggested improvements.
- Pseudocode for game simulation was developed.

## Final Code
- Despite efforts, the final code had implementation issues.
- GenAI struggled with syntax errors, scoring calculations, and interactive gameplay.

## Analysis and Conclusion
- Strengths included understanding complexity and providing strategic insights.
- Weaknesses included implementation accuracy and dependency on human intervention.
- Collaboration between humans and AI remains essential for practical applications.
